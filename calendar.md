## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* The venues book up fast. Book quickly.
* Don't take too long or think too hard about the sponsor prospectus.
* Tickets usually start going after speakers are announced. Don't panic.
* Get those CFP acceptances out as quickly as possible, as some of your speakers may have early deadlines or long waits for getting corporate travel approval, visa approvals, and more.
* Never announce the speaker list until all speaker spots have been filled and all proposal authors have been notified about a decision. Keep that goodwill high.
* As a group, always set up a run-of-show schedule. This is your master schedule and the source of truth. Use it. Love it.
