# Cloud Native Rejekts Runbooks

Use this repository as a place to hold runbooks and role definitions for various organizing functions.

## Calendar

A quick overview of timing for most conferences can be found in [the calendar expectations file](calendar.md).

## Roles

The roles outlined in the [roles directory](roles) are generally optional. Sometimes all of the roles are filled by different people, and sometimes people fill more than one role. It depends on the general size of your organizing team.

## Runbooks

The runbooks found in the [runbooks directory](runbooks) define general information about tasks to get done and when to expect to be done them, as well as common mistakes to watch for.

If you need to make a new runbook, copy the [template](runbooks/template.md) to get started.

## Credit

To start, this repository borrowed heavily from [DevOpsDays Austin's runbooks](https://github.com/devopsdays-austin/runbooks) and [PyTexas's runbooks](https://github.com/pytexas/runbooks/tree/main/docs) (because [Laura (@nimbinatus)](https://github.com/nimbinatus) works with both). Thank you.
