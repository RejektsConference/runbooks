# Swag Coordinator

The SWAG role is responsible for all things SWAG, depending on what you're doing for this event. You'll get everything for attendees, speakers, and organizers/volunteers. This includes something to identify an attendee (e.g., badges and lanyards), giveaways like t-shirts, and gifts for speakers/organizers/volunteers.
