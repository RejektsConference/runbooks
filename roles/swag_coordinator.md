# Signage and Swag Coordinator

The Signage and Swag role is responsible for branded signage around the venue, external signage to ensure attendees can find the event and for all things Swag. You will get signage for the stage and podiums, and any other signage to ensure smooth run of event. You'll also get everything for attendees, speakers, and organizers/volunteers. This includes something to identify an attendee (e.g., badges and lanyards), giveaways like t-shirts, stickers, and gifts for speakers/organizers/volunteers. You will need to work with the finance coordinator to ensure you are within budget. 

You will need to work with local vendors. All items have to be at the venue ahead of the event. You will have to work with the venue coordinator and the registration coordinator to ensure that all items are delivered to the correct location.
