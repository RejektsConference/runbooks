# Food

Most venues make their money off of food sales by requiring you to use their vendor or themselves. Depending on the venue, the food organizer may be the same as the venue organizer. If there is a separate food organizer, work closely with the venue lead to make sure everyone gets fed.

## Role description

Your job is to make sure that the attendees get breakfast and an afternoon snack each day along with coffee, tea, and other beverages.
