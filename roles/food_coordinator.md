# Morning Beverages and Snacks

Historically, Rejekts does not provide lunch. We encourage folks to venture around town for a lengthy lunch. We do, however, ensure that we provide good quality coffee and some pastries for our attendees upon their arrival. You will work with the venue coordinator to see what the venue provides/allows. Depending on the venue, the food organizer may be the same as the venue organizer. If there is a separate food organizer, work closely with the venue lead to make sure that the attendees arrive to hot coffee and a light food spread. In some cases, the individual in this role might need to search externally for a vendor. Work with the financial coordinator to secure appropriate budget.

## Role description

Your job is to make sure that the attendees get good quality coffee (including tea and other beverages) upon arrival and some light food like pastries and fruit.

Additional task is to provide a local list of possible lunch options for attendees, within walking distance with various dietary options.
