# Speakers/CFP

## Role description

The CFP committee (or team) is the group of individuals that brings the agenda together for the event. Without the CFP committee, the event would have a challenging time bringing people together to discuss and engage. It takes commitment throughout the year to understand what would bring the best conversations.

### Program Committee

The program committee is a selection of (at least) 5 people who will be voting on the proposed CFPs for our conference, and people selected should reflect a wide cross-section of perspectives when it comes to selecting talks. They will help shape and decide on the agenda and content, though the organizing team will have a final say. All organizers are part of the program committee, ideally, and you should also include some people who are known to be good reviewers in the community. Generally, to avoid favoritism, committee members _should not_ propose talks or should recuse themselves from reviewing their own, or their co-workers, proposals due to conflict of interest.
