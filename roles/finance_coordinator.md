# Finance Coordinator

Ensure the budget is created and maintained. Pay all the things. Interface with ConferenceOps, our third-party vendor.

## Role description

For Finance, the primary responsibility is to establish the budget prior to the conference and keep folks on track to pull off a great conference day-of while leaving enough to get things started again next year. The target will vary from conference to conference depending on location. The goal is to ensure that there are monies left over for the next conference, make a venue deposit, pay vendors before sponsorships start coming in, and pay for ongoing maintenance and conference development costs.

There is a secondary responsibility which lies with all organizers and volunteers, to keep the entire team updated with a clear understanding of what has been committed to, what has been spent, what reimbursement is needed, and any other information which would affect the financial status of the conference.
