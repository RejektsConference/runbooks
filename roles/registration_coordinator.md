# Registration/Attendees

## Role description

The role of registration is centered around the idea of supplying tickets to our attendees + vendors + speakers. The registration team needs to collaborate and work with other organizer teams (specifically Website, Swag, and Volunteers) since multiple areas are tightly coupled with the registration organizer team.
