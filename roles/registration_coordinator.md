# Registration/Attendees

## Role description

The role of registration is centered around the idea of supplying tickets to our attendees + vendors + speakers. The registration team needs to collaborate and work with other organizer teams (specifically Website, Swag, and Volunteers) since multiple areas are tightly coupled with the registration organizer team.

This individual will need to set up the registration table the day before the conference, ensuring that everything is ready for the morning. They will work with the venue to ensure the area has what it needs (power, laptops, swag, badges, etc.) Ensure that the area is easily found by attendees, working with the Signage/Swag team.
