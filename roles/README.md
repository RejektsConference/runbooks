# Audio/Visual (A/V) Coordinator

## Role description

This role focuses on working with vendors to provide A/V for the conference. That includes recording all talks, having microphones for all speakers, doing a livestream if you're having one, providing power and other things to various areas of the conference, etc.

# Finance

Ensure the budget is created and maintained. Pay all the things. Interface with ConferenceOps.

## Role description

For Finance, the primary responsibility is to establish the budget prior to the conference and keep folks on track to pull off a great conference day-of while leaving enough to get things started again next year (target is 100K USD remaining after the conference is complete, to make a venue deposit, pay vendors before sponsorships start coming in, and pay for ongoing maintenance and conference development costs).

There is a secondary responsibility which lies with all organizers and volunteers, to keep the entire team updated with a clear understanding of what has been committed to, what has been spent, what reimbursement is needed, and any other information which would affect the financial status of the conference.

# Food

Most venues make their money off of food sales by requiring you to use their vendor or themselves. Depending on the venue, the food organizer may be the same as the venue organizer. If there is a separate food organizer, work closely with the venue lead to make sure everyone gets fed.

## Role description

Your job is to make sure that the attendees get breakfast and an afternoon snack each day along with coffee, tea, and other beverages.

# Marketing

## Role description

This role is responsible for the image, branding, social media posts, and everything else that has to do with what an attendee or potential attendee sees or hears about this event's Rejekts.

# Main Ceremony Host (MC) Role

While the MC role is a day-of role that does not have a specific organizer function, there are a number of key elements that are required for a good MC. You can think of a good MC from any awards show or variety show---innocuous, friendly, and lightly entertaining without being abrasive or controversial.

## Role description

This role is the face of each talk track. The person who fills this role introduces speakers, kicks off and moderates Q&A, fills in empty airtime that isn't taken by a break, and helps a speaker feel more comfortable on stage should technical issues arise or should a speaker speed through their talk.

* As a fantastic reference, [Heidi Waterhouse wrote up information on how to be a great MC](https://heidiwaterhouse.com/2020/07/09/lady-conference-speaker-now-more-than-ever/#:~:text=of%20your%20talk.-,MC%20work,-One%20of%20my).

# Registration/Attendees

## Role description

The role of registration is centered around the idea of supplying tickets to our attendees + vendors + speakers. The registration team needs to collaborate and work with other organizer teams (specifically Website, Swag, and Volunteers) since multiple areas are tightly coupled with the registration organizer team.

---

# Speakers/CFP

## Role description

The CFP committee (or team) is the group of individuals that brings the agenda together for the event. Without the CFP committee, the event would have a challenging time bringing people together to discuss and engage. It takes commitment throughout the year to understand what would bring the best conversations.

### Program Committee

The program committee is a selection of (at least) 5 people who will be voting on the proposed CFPs for our conference, and people selected should reflect a wide cross-section of perspectives when it comes to selecting talks. They will help shape and decide on the agenda and content, though the organizing team will have a final say. All organizers are part of the program committee, ideally, and you should also include some people who are known to be good reviewers in the community. Generally, to avoid favoritism, committee members _should not_ propose talks or should recuse themselves from reviewing their own, or their co-workers, proposals due to conflict of interest.

# Sponsors Coordinator

## Role description

This role is responsible for managing the interaction with sponsors from sales through the overall execution of the event. You are the primary driver of conference revenue.


---

# Steering Committee

The Rejekts Steering Committee is a guiding body to help Rejekts events run around the world.


---

# Swag Coordinator

The SWAG role is responsible for all things SWAG, depending on what you're doing for this event. You'll get everything for attendees, speakers, and organizers/volunteers. This includes something to identify an attendee (e.g., badges and lanyards), giveaways like t-shirts, stickers, and gifts for speakers/organizers/volunteers.


---

# Venue Organizer

Venue and food represent the majority of the conference budget. Your job directly affects every other functional area and impacts the conference budget. The venue determines how many attendees can come, how many sponsorships can be sold, the food options, A/V placement, etc.

## Role description

The venue lead is responsible for making sure that the venue is setup to run the conference. This includes making sure that there's:

- Space for sponsors to set up their tables.
- Room for food/beverage/hallway track.
- At least two stages for talks.

The venue lead is the key to making sure the event happens. Your job is to make sure that the venue has all the space and equipment to put on a great conference. You'll also be coordinating with many of your fellow leads so that their functional areas are set up for success.

# Volunteers

The volunteers are the heart of the event execution. This group of folks take on many roles to ensure that the conference is an amazing event for the attendees.

## Role description
