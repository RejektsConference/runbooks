# Audio/Visual (A/V) Coordinator

## Role description

This role focuses on securing and working with the AV vendor. Sometimes the venue provides the A/V in-house but other times a vendor needs to be secured externally. This role will need to establish what is needed to successfully execute the conference, depending on the venue and what is provided onsite. This includes recording all talks, securing and/or designing branded slides for each talk, doing a livestream if you're having one, providing power and other things to various areas of the conference, posting all talks on the Cloud Native Rejekts YouTube channel, etc.
