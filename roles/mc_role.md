# Master of Ceremony (MC) Role

While the MC role is a day-of role that does not have a specific organizer function, there are a number of key elements that are required for a good MC. You can think of a good MC from any awards show or variety show---innocuous, friendly, and lightly entertaining without being abrasive or controversial.

## Role description

This role is the face of the conference. The person who fills this role kicks off the conferernce, fills in empty airtime that isn't taken by a break, makes logistical announcements where needed, moderates the lightning talks if you have them, thanks the sponsors, and closes out the conference on the last day. 

This role can be executed by one person, or two people alternating between morning and afternoon, or a duo.
