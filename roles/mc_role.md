# Main Ceremony Host (MC) Role

While the MC role is a day-of role that does not have a specific organizer function, there are a number of key elements that are required for a good MC. You can think of a good MC from any awards show or variety show---innocuous, friendly, and lightly entertaining without being abrasive or controversial.

## Role description

This role is the face of each talk track. The person who fills this role introduces speakers, kicks off and moderates Q&A, fills in empty airtime that isn't taken by a break, and helps a speaker feel more comfortable on stage should technical issues arise or should a speaker speed through their talk.
