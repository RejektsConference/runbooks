## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Spend "real time" with the CFP software before opening the CFP. It can be tricky.
* Gain the muscle to find "sales pitches" abstracts, but don't beat yourself up if one slips through.
* Keep voting simple for the program committee. A "will you attend this talk" question with a simple `-1, 0, 1` or `Yes, Maybe, No` works just fine, with the idea that enough people voting will raise anything that's actually interesting for the community.
* Give people enough time to vote. Depending on the amount of submissions, you may need more than a week. Typically, though, if you're getting fewer than 200-300 submissions and have a simple voting system, a week should be enough time (include a weekend).
* Never announce speakers on a rolling basis. People who are stuck in limbo get a bad impression. Wait to announce anything until everyone's been notified of the appropriate decision for their talk.
