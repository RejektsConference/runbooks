# Audio/Visual (A/V)

## General Tasks

- Identify, select, and negotiate with potential A/V vendors.
- Set up a timing system (e.g., paper signs, computer-based timers) for speakers.
- Plan with volunteer coordinator for necessary staffing for timing team.
- Work with the venue to meet A/V vendor needs and sponsor needs (power drops, strips, and monitors).
- Provide a list of local A/V rental solutions for sponsors.
- Review vendor footage to ensure all recordings are good.
- Upload all recordings to YouTube channel.

## Important Dates

### In the beginning

- If possible, visit the venue to understand the layout.
- Get budget from finance team.

### 6 Months Out

- Put out call for proposals for A/V vendors. Ask prior team for template as needed.
- Vet and narrow down vendors.

### 3 Months Out

- Ensure you have selected a vendor and started negotiations and contract signing. This *will* take time.

### 2 Months Out

- By now volunteer organizer should be getting volunteer counts and have reached out to volunteers, so get your needs over to them. 
- Ensure your volunteer needs are on the schedule.
- Set up time for the vendor to walk through the venue. Be there for that walkthrough.

### 2 Weeks Out

- Hold training for volunteers, if needed.
- Check in with the vendor to ensure they have all needs met.

### The Week Before

- By now, all timing should be finalized for the vendor to arrive at the venue. Ensure it's on the master schedule.

### The Day Before

- Set up any timing system in each room.
- Be a runner for the vendor as needed for working with the organizing team and the venue.

### The Day Of

- Make sure it runs smoothly. Check in on each room before/after each talk, and be available for questions.

### Afterwards

- Check in with the vendor on recordings. Make sure they go up within a month of the conference.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

- Don't wait until the last minute to find vendors. The good ones will likely already be contracted for KubeCon ancilliary events or recordings.
- Have a rotation of volunteers, and have someone who can relieve you. You will need a few breaks during the day, so always have a backup communicated out to everyone.
