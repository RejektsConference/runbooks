# Registration/Attendees

This runbook is focused on Registration and attendees and what you need to prep for taking on this role! There are a several key elements that are needed to be done before, during, and after the conference to ensure a successful completion of the Registration role.

## General Tasks

* Coordinate when we should promote ticket sales (Early Bird, Normal Sale, etc.).
* Work with Swag to ensure we have enough swag (t-shirts, lanyards, badges, etc.) for the total number of attendees.
* Work with Volunteer Coordinator to properly staff registration tables.
* Send emails or reminders leading up to the conference to make sure everyone understands expectations + rules.
* Work the registration table the day of: scan tickets, pass out Swag, ensure attendees are comfortable on what to expect for the conference.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Ensure Ticket Registration does not open early (before early-bird sales date).
