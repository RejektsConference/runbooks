# Venue

## General Tasks

* Coordinate with the venue on layout.
* Arrange a walkthrough for the organizer team.
* Ensure A/V has what they need to work with vendors.
* Ensure the sponsor coordinator knows how much space they can work with, has enough tables, and has the power needed for vendors.
* Ensure the food coordinator has space to set up food and drink.
* Ensure registration, swag, and volunteers know what space they have to use for various functions.

### 12 Months Out

* Start the venue search.

### 6 Months Out

* Identify the venue.
* Pay the deposit and agree to the fee schedule.
* Organize an organizer site survey. Take pictures to share, and gather questions from those who can't make it to ask.
* Determine the conference layout, and create a diagram.
  * Determine how many sponsors can fit in a space.

### 3 Months Out

* Finalize the venue contract.
  * It should include line items for everything you're paying for. Update the conference spreadsheet with the projected cost. After this point the only thing to update with the conference is the guest total. Keep an eye on ticket sales and adjust the contract (and costs) as needed.

### <1 Month Out

* Pay the rest of the venue rental fee.
* Provide the venue with a list of all sponsors or exhibitors and a list of all food vendors (coordinate with the food organizer).
* Get conference insurance.
  * Usually, you must provide a Certificate of Insurance (COI). Details can be found in your venue's contract.

### The Week Before

* Identify any last-minute changes with the venue, including adjustments to sponsor layout and attendee totals.

### The Day Before

* Be there for setup. Make sure that you know who to contact on site from the venue if there are any last-minute hurdles.

### The Day Of

* Check in with your venue contact periodically to make sure everything is on schedule and smooth.
* Be available for questions from the organizing team. 

## Common Mistakes or Reminders

* Venues book early and quickly. Don't procrastinate!
* When choosing a venue, go to each space and review it versus relying on pictures from the venue's site. They always use fisheye lenses to make a space feel bigger, and you don't know whether something has changed the space since the picture was taken.
* Create a spreadsheet with details for each venue so you can compare them quickly.
* Don't be afraid to ask questions while exploring venues!
  * Get capacity numbers.
  * Get what equipment is included in a rental (projectors? tablecloths? the stage? podiums? power cables and extension cords to the sponsor tables?), and how they're charging you (e.g., per chair, per specific layout, per power drop).
  * Get information on vendors. Do you have to use theirs for everything from food to A/V? What's the charge for bringing in your own vendor?
  * Get information on the wifi. We all know what chaos conference wifi can be like, and you need to know if they have it and whether they charge for it.
  * Find out about the shipping policy for both Rejekts and sponsors. Shipping is always something sponsors ask about.
  * Find out information on the payment schedule and a refund policy if you have to back out.
  * Find out whether you can set up the day before, and what they'll charge you for it.
* The COI can be confusing if you've never done it. Ask for help, and consider local insurance vendors who can work with you to get you a good deal.
* Most larger venues make their money by locking you into their vendors for food, A/V, etc. Hotels are the most expensive places to host a conference, but they're also set up exclusively to host them. If you go with a venue that's not a hotel, you may still be required to use their food vendor.
  * Ideally, you'll try for a space that has a lot of flexibility for vendors, which lowers the cost of the event significantly.
* You need an estimate of the conference size to start determining a venue. A good guide is that most non-hotels can handle 400 or fewer attendees. Above 400 attendees, you will probably be locked into using a hotel. As Rejekts is usually much smaller, explore other venue options as much as you can.
* Try to get close to the venue for KubeCon. Consider the tradeoff of cost (it's probably going to be more expensive to be nearby) and getting there for people who already are there for KubeCon (too far away or too far from good transit, and you'll get fewer people). People will not move their hotel for Rejekts.
* Always check that they have the ability to host talks with projectors (or very large TVs that can be read at the back of the room) and microphones when considering a space. The A/V coordinator will thank you if they don't have to rely on a vendor bringing in TVs or a projector system since that's very expensive.
  * Also, ask if a vendor can patch into their A/V system to pull feeds. That usually is a much nicer experience for attendees and speakers; it can be difficult to make systems work nicely, but we work in tech and are used to that.
* Don't forget to consider the hallway space and a sponsor space. Do not plan to put sponsors in a far room or corner. People don't stop there to say hi. Put sponsor tables along common corridors or in a common space with registration so people are more likely to spot something interesting and go talk.
