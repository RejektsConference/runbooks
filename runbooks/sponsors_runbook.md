# Sponsor runbook

## General Tasks

* Work with the broader team to define sponsorship opportunities for the event (what offerings are possible, pricing, execution plan, quantity, etc.)
* Manage the sales process of sponsorship opportunities from initial contact through to payment and finally fulfillment
* Manage sponsor communications to ensure that any questions that arise are handled in a timely manner
* Manage sponsor fulfillment during the event and ensure that they have a great experience

### General Guidance on Sponsors

* Sponsor revenue is the primary source of income for the event. Starting as early as possible---ideally as soon as the budget is set---is crucial. Getting sponsors signed on as early as possible represents important cashflow for the event's budget. This is where the cash comes from to pay vendors, etc. Early revenue is particularly important as some of the biggest expenses (venue, catering) expect payment or large deposits up-front and therefore relatively early in the event planning cycle.
* Sponsor experience is important, but it is lower in importance than attendee experience.
* Sponsors will ask for all sorts of things; be comfortable saying 'no'.
* It is OK to discourage or reject sponsors that do not fit or that might be problematic.
* Value the sponsorship opportunities you are selling; if you do not, your sponsors will not.
* Do not discount unless there is a very good reason, and do so ONLY with the agreement of the overall team. There are a LOT of companies that want to connect with the community, so there is usually someone else who will buy at full price.
* Maintain a very short decision loop between yourself and the organizers; you need to be able to respond to sponsors quickly (think within 12-24 hours) when they ask something off-the-wall.
* Maintain a very close working relationship with finance; they are your best operational resource.
* Never assume a sponsor understands something or has the correct expectation; ALWAYS send it in writing and do not be afraid to repeat yourself.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Always sign your emails as sponsor coordinator of the event.
* Make sure sponsors remain communicative---check when they go quiet---in case of marketing turnover.
* Get sponsor events into run-of-show schedule while the schedule is being created (do not wait for specific speaker scheduling; use 'slot type' placeholders).
* Get granular with the schedule to structure sponsor shoutouts.
* Work with marketing coordinator to make noise, like immediately announcing sponsors as they are confirmed, not just close to the show.
* Get the sponsor sales started early enough in to generate interest and catch end-of-year budget, if needed.
* Update demographic information from prior year's event.

## Sponsor Fulfillment Workflow

1. When you receive interest from a sponsor, start tracking it.
2. If you get a verbal commit on a sponsorship, update the Activity Tab and add them to the Fulfillment Tab.
3. Once we have received payment, ask the sponsors for their corporate logo and a blurb to use for social media posts. Coordinate with the Marketing Organizer to send a sponsor shoutout on social media. Work with the Website Organizer to add the logo to our website.
4. Send a description of their sponsorship level and all entitlements to the sponsor so they have it explicitly spelled out what they've paid for. Send a link to the Sponsorship FAQ you've made.
5. Follow the rest of the runbook for when to send messages.
