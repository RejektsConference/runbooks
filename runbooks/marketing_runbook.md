# Marketing

## General Tasks

* Create social media posts
* Send out emails to promote the event
* Interact with anyone posting about Rejekts.
* Report on marketing efforts regularly.
* Create digital assets as needed.

## Important Dates

### In the beginning

* Plan omni-channel marketing strategy.
* Start posting about the organizing team to social media.
* Start emailing to the newsletter that the next event is coming.

### Reactive

* While the CFP is open, schedule regular posts to social media channels to get speakers.
* While registration is open, schedule regular posts to attract attendees.
* When the call for volunteers is open, schedule regular posts to attract volunteers.
* While the sponsorship prospectus is open, schedule regular posts to attract sponsors.
* Whenever a sponsor is finalized, create graphics and schedule a post to say thank you.

### 2 Months Out (or when finalized)
* Create speaker and session cards (graphics).
* Announce speakers and talks on social media and the newsletter to drive attendance.
* Schedule a regular cadence of posts, one for each speaker/session, using the graphics.
  * Typically, this is twice a day leading up to the conference.
* If possible, contact local coffee shops, companies, and coworking spaces to get permission to post flyers or otherwise notify their people that the event is happening.

### 1 Month Out
* Keep posting! Your schedule may need to get filled here and there.
* Finalize training material for day-of posts from volunteers and orgs

### The Week Before
* Post general posts with all sessions.
* Post general thank you posts with all sponsors on one post (do not single out any one sponsor; they get one separate callout per contract usually).
* Help ensure comms are sent to attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers as needed.

### The Day Before
* Post a reminder to social media and the newsletter that the event is tomorrow.

### The Day Of

* Interact with folks who post their experiences via social media (like, reply, repost).
* Coordinate with marketing volunteers to get social posts drafted and sent out.
* Ensure the conference is being represented appropriately.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes
* Use a scheduling tool to post to social media. It's much easier than trying to remember to do it yourself.
