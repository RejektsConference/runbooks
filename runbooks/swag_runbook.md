# Swag

## General Tasks

* Coordinate the creation of the swag designs

## Important Dates

### 5 Months Before

* Finalize shirt, badge, gift designs.
* Get t-shirt samples with colors and various sizes.
* Get gift samples.

### 2 Months Before

* Order speaker gifts (might be earlier depending on production time).
  * Usually these are nicer, so the production time may be longer.
* Design the badge. The vendor may help with this.
* Start the lanyard process based on expected number of attendees.
  * If there is a lanyard sponsor, the lanyards must, at a minimum, have the sponsor's logo. Consider adding the Rejekts logo.
* Review current budget.

### 1 Month Before

* Order lanyards if you have not already.
* Order badges (with some blank cards).
* Order gifts.

### 3 Weeks Before

### 2 Weeks Before

* Order shirts with current attendees sizes with buffer for limit.
* Order shirts with current volunteers sizes with buffer.

* Print final speakers List - work with the speakers lead.
* Print volunteers/org list - work with volunteers lead.

### The Day Before

* Badges
  * Obtain list of late registrations that did not have name printed on badges and print names on labels.
    * Note that you might just use a permanent marker the day of. It doesn't need to be fancy.
  * Coordinate with volunteers to place badges in plastic sleeves if required.
  * Coordinate with volunteers to organize badges.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Badges are tough. It is a fine line between badge production time and names on badges. There are a lot of folks who sign up to attend the conference late, and the fancier the badge, the longer the production time.
  * Also get a double-sided badge with a name on both sides, if possible.
* Try and find a local badge vendor.
* Decide on the swag designs early. The longer it takes to get the design, the less time you have for everything else.
* Have a plan for extras/overage. Donations, bringing it to KubeCon to give out for the next event, etc.
